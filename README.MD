# Features
CardMerge has the ability to merge 2 card by its rank or suit, to create a "merged card". Cards with merged suits will have the same logic as a wild card, or if the Smeared Joker is active. Cards with merged ranks will be activated by their respective jokers, letting you compact your playstyle down into more efficient plays!

The mod comes with 12 new suits, which result from merging the vanilla suits in different ways.
